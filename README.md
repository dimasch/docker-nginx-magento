192.168.59.103	  kmplzt.dev

```sh
127.0.0.1    localhost kmplzt.dev
```

#### XDebug start/stop:

```shell
./scripts/xdebug-start.sh
./scripts/xdebug-stop.sh
```

## Comments

In our example the magento container is linked to the mysql container under the alias db.
This means that you'll have to edit your config file in such a way that the mysql host is no longer localhost but db.
